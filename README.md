# Java Interview Notes

## 1. HashMap, TreeMap, and Ordering in Collections

### Question:
What is the output of the following code? Explain why it behaves that way.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        map.put("apple", 1);
        map.put("banana", 2);
        map.put("orange", 3);
        
        map.put("banana", 4);
        map.put("apple", 5);
        
        System.out.println(map);
    }
}
Expected Answer:
The output of the code will be:

Copy code
{orange=3, apple=5, banana=4}
Explanation:
HashMap does not maintain the order of the elements based on their insertion. It uses a hash table to store the keys and values, and the order of entries in the map is based on the hash codes of the keys.
Behavior:
"apple" is inserted with value 1, then updated with value 5.
"banana" is inserted with value 2, then updated with value 4.
"orange" is inserted with value 3 and is not updated.
The map.put() method replaces the old value for a key if the key already exists.
However, HashMap does not guarantee order of elements. The keys will appear in an order determined by their hash codes, not in the order they were inserted.
Trick:
Many people may expect the output to maintain the insertion order, but since HashMap does not guarantee order, the keys can appear in any order, typically based on their hash codes.
If the requirement is to maintain order:
LinkedHashMap (for insertion order)
TreeMap (for sorted order) should be used instead.
2. Thread-Safe Collections with Ordering
2.1. Thread-Safe with Insertion Order:
To maintain insertion order while ensuring thread safety, use Collections.synchronizedMap() along with LinkedHashMap.

Example:
java
Copy code
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, Integer> map = Collections.synchronizedMap(new LinkedHashMap<>());

        map.put("apple", 1);
        map.put("banana", 2);
        map.put("orange", 3);
        
        map.put("banana", 4);
        map.put("apple", 5);
        
        synchronized (map) {  // Synchronize the block for iteration
            System.out.println(map);
        }
    }
}
Explanation:
LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order of elements.
Collections.synchronizedMap() makes the map thread-safe by synchronizing all map operations (e.g., put, get, etc.).
If you iterate through the map, you need to synchronize the iteration manually (synchronized(map) block) to avoid ConcurrentModificationException and ensure thread safety during iteration.
2.2. Thread-Safe with Sorted Order:
To ensure thread safety while maintaining sorted order, you can use Collections.synchronizedMap() with TreeMap.

Example:
java
Copy code
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, Integer> map = Collections.synchronizedMap(new TreeMap<>());

        map.put("apple", 1);
        map.put("banana", 2);
        map.put("orange", 3);
        
        map.put("banana", 4);
        map.put("apple", 5);
        
        synchronized (map) {  // Synchronize the block for iteration
            System.out.println(map);
        }
    }
}
Explanation:
TreeMap maintains the elements in sorted order based on their natural ordering or a comparator if provided.
Collections.synchronizedMap() makes it thread-safe, ensuring thread-safe operations.
Similar to the previous example, when iterating, you must synchronize the block to avoid concurrent modification issues.
Summary:
For insertion order + thread safety: Use Collections.synchronizedMap(new LinkedHashMap<>()).
For sorted order + thread safety: Use Collections.synchronizedMap(new TreeMap<>()).
Both of these approaches ensure that your map is thread-safe while maintaining the desired ordering (insertion order or sorted order).
3. Class Files Generated in Various Scenarios
Scenario: Outer Class + Inner Class
Generated class files: Parent.class, Parent$Child.class
Scenario: Outer Class + Static Inner Class
Generated class files: School.class, School$Student.class
Scenario: Outer Class + Anonymous Inner Class
Generated class files: Person.class, Person$1.class
Scenario: Outer Class + Lambda
Generated class files: Parent.class, Parent$Lambda$0.class
Conclusion:
This document provides insights into important Java collection concepts like HashMap vs. LinkedHashMap vs. TreeMap and their thread-safety options. It also covers class file generation scenarios, which can help in understanding how Java compiles and stores inner and anonymous classes.
